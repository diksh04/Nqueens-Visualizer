<h3>N-Queens Visualizer</h3>

<p>The N-Queens problem is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics that involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. It's a popular problem used to demonstrate various algorithms and data structures. The N-Queens visualizer can be used to demonstrate various algorithms for solving the N-Queens problem. This includes backtracking algorithms, genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and other optimization techniques. By visualizing the process of how these algorithms work, students and enthusiasts can gain a better understanding of the underlying concepts.</p>
